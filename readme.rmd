#Overview

This repo contains the r script and supporting files for the Getting and Cleaning Data project.  The r script to reproduce the output file (tidydata.txt) is run_analysis.R.  The r script will download the required zip file from the given url to the OS temp directory, load all the necessary files from the zip repo and then delete the zip file.  This makes the script entirely self contained.
