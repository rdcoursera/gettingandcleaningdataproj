Overview
========

This repo contains the r script and supporting files for the Getting and
Cleaning Data project. The r script to reproduce the output file
(tidydata.txt) is run\_analysis.R. The r script will download the
required zip file from the given url to the OS temp directory, load all
the necessary files from the zip repo and then delete the zip file. This
makes the script entirely self contained.
